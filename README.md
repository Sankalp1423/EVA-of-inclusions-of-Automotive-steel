# EVA-of-inclusions-of-Automotive-steel
It required various skills like automotive steel sample polishing by abrasive papers of different grit sizes, cloth polishing(using alumina and ethanol).
Microscopy was performed on these samples, then we performed Extreme Value Analysis on the inclusions.
Extreme value analysis (EVA) focuses on the largest inclusions in the steel matrix, as the largest inclusion is statistically the most likely to initiate failure.
